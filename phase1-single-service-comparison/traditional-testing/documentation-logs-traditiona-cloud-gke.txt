Pipeline Metrics:
  - Total Duration: 183 seconds
  - Status: FAILED
  - Manual Interventions: 0 (Failed before approvals)
  - Automation Level: 60% (Build/Test/Deploy automated, Approvals manual)

Research Notes:
Testing Traditional CI/CD failure detection and early pipeline termination. This simulation measures how quickly the pipeline identifies build failures, terminates execution to prevent resource waste, and provides developer feedback. The failure occurs during the build stage (after source analysis but before manual approvals), demonstrating the automated failure detection capabilities inherent in Traditional CI/CD workflows.

Research Objective:
Quantify Traditional CI/CD failure handling efficiency: (1) Time-to-failure detection speed, (2) Resource consumption of failed vs successful pipelines, (3) Pipeline termination effectiveness. This data establishes baseline failure recovery performance for comparison with GitOps failure handling mechanisms. Critical for understanding how each methodology handles build failures and prevents unnecessary manual intervention cycles.
