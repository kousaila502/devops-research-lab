## Sheet 5: Development Velocity Impact

### Daily Development Metrics
| Metric | GitOps | Traditional | Difference | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Average Build Time | 132.5s | 57s | +75.5s | Slower feedback |
| Deployment Frequency | 2.75/day | 0.15/day | +2.6/day | Higher velocity |
| Manual Interventions | 0 | 0 | 0 | Equal automation |
| Setup Complexity | High | Low | +High | Higher barrier |
| Operational Control | Full | Limited | +Full | Better governance |

### Weekly Development Impact (5 days)
| Metric | GitOps | Traditional | Weekly Difference |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Total Build Time | 55 minutes | 24 minutes | +31 minutes |
| Total Deployments | 13.75 | 0.75 | +13 deployments |
| Infrastructure Changes | Unlimited | Limited | Significant |
| Cost (Basic Tier) | $0 (GKE free tier) | $70 | -$70 savings |

## Formulas Used:
- Performance Ratio = Build Time ÷ Complexity Score
- Resource Efficiency = (Used Memory ÷ Allocated Memory) × 100
- Over-provisioning Cost = (1 - Resource Efficiency) × 100
- Weekly Build Time = Daily Average × Deployments/Day × 5 days
- Platform Overhead = Configuration Lines + Setup Complexity Score
