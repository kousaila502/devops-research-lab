# Testing Environment Setup

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Evolution Journey

### Phase 1: Local Development (Minikube)
**Initial Setup:**
- **Platform:** Minikube on Windows 11
- **Resources:** 3 CPU cores, 8GB RAM allocation
- **Memory Pressure:** 90%+ host utilization (500-700MB free)
- **Purpose:** Baseline establishment and initial testing

**Minikube Configuration:**
```bash
minikube start --cpus=3 --memory=8g --disk-size=20g
Limitations Identified:

Resource constraints affecting concurrent testing
Limited to development hours availability
Shared resources with host system
Network latency variations

Phase 2: Cloud Migration (Google Kubernetes Engine)
Migration Rationale:

Need for production-grade infrastructure
24/7 availability requirements
Consistent performance measurement environment
Professional research credibility
